# migrator: naisd to naiserator migration

Nais daemon is being switched off 02.02.2020. The successor is [Naiserator](https://github.com/nais/naiserator).

Migrator helps with transitioning between systems by converting your `nais.yaml` to Naiserator syntax.

Optionally, it also pulls environment variables and secrets from _Fasit_ to your local drive.
